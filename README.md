# ðŸ“˜ My Next.js Dashboard Project â€“ What I Learned

This project was part of the official [Next.js Learn](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app) tutorial, where I built a modern dashboard application using the **App Router**.  
It was a hands-on journey that helped me better understand how to structure and build real-world applications with Next.js.

## âœ… Learning Steps

### 1. Getting Started
- Initialized a new app using `npx create-next-app@latest`.
- Selected the **App Router** architecture to explore the latest features of Next.js.
- Learned about the project structure:
  - `/app` directory
  - `layout.tsx` and `page.tsx` files
  - Differences between server-side rendering and static generation.

### 2. CSS Styling
- Applied global styles through `globals.css`.
- Used **CSS Modules** for component-specific styles.
- Understood the importance of modular and scoped CSS.
- Also experimented with **Tailwind CSS**, which made styling much faster and cleaner using utility classes.

### 3. Optimizing Fonts and Images
- Used the `next/font` module to load Google Fonts in an optimized way.
- Implemented responsive and lazy-loaded images using the `next/image` component.
- Improved app performance with better font and image handling.

### 4. Creating Layouts and Pages
- Built reusable layouts using `layout.tsx` and folder-based routing inside `/app`.
- Created different pages like `/dashboard`, `/invoices`, and more using `page.tsx`.
- Learned how to use **nested layouts** to share components like headers and sidebars across pages.

### 5. Navigation Between Pages
- Implemented navigation using the `Link` component from `next/link`.
- Explored **client-side transitions** for smooth page changes.
- Maintained layout and state while navigating between different sections.
