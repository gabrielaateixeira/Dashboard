## âœ… Chapters Overview

### 1. Getting Started
**URL:** [Getting Started](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app/getting-started)

- Installed Next.js and initialized a new app with `npx create-next-app@latest`.
- Chose the **App Router** architecture.
- Learned about the structure of a Next.js project including:
  - `/app` directory

- Created and imported **component-level styles** with CSS Modules (e.g., `Button.module.css`).
- Learned the importance of **modular and scoped CSS** in Next.js.
- Used **Tailwind CSS** classes for utility-based styling (optional but recommended).

### 3. Optimizing Fonts and Images
**URL:** [Optimizing Fonts and Images](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app/optimizing-fonts-images)

### 4. Creating Layouts and Pages
**URL:** [Creating Layouts and Pages](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app/creating-layouts-and-pages)

- Built **nested layouts** using `layout.tsx` and segment folders under `/app`.
- Created multiple pages with `page.tsx` for each route (e.g., `/dashboard`, `/invoices`, etc.).
- Used **layout nesting** for shared components (like sidebars and headers) across routes.

### 5. Navigating Between Pages
**URL:** [Navigating Between Pages](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app/navigating-between-pages)
